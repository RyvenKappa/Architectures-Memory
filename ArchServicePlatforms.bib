  abstract = {In many developing countries, agriculture is one of the primary livelihoods of common people. Agriculture requires various types of technologies for improving crop yields. The attack of animals in the agricultural land and the theft of crops by humans cause heavy loss in cultivation. In this work, we propose a hardware prototype using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for intruder detection in an agricultural field. The proposed system is named Agricultural Intrusion Detection (AID). AID helps to generate alarms in the farmer's house and at the same time transmits a text message to the farmer's cell phone when an intruder enters into the field. In order to implement the proposed scheme, we design and deploy Advanced Virtual RISC (AVR) micro-controller-based wireless sensor boards over an outdoor environment and evaluate the performance.},

The sensor-networks node is implemented via the principle of an embedded system incorporating passive infrared sensors, a long-range (LoRa) module, and a solar panel for energy harvesting. For experimental purposes, a small IoT sensor network was implemented near the road. The network consists of eight nodes placed near the road with a distance of 50 m between nodes, a gateway for gathering detection data from the nodes, and a thermo-vision camera for verification of the received data.},

  abstract = {Sigfox has become one of the main Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies, as it has attracted the attention of the industry, academy and standards development organizations in recent years. Sigfox devices, such as sensors or actuators, are expected to run on limited energy sources; therefore, it is crucial to investigate the energy consumption of Sigfox. However, the literature has only focused on this topic to a very limited extent. This paper presents an analytical model that characterizes device current consumption, device lifetime and energy cost of data delivery with Sigfox. In order to capture a realistic behavior, the model has been derived from measurements carried out on a real Sigfox hardware module. The model allows quantifying the impact of relevant Sigfox parameters and mechanisms, as well as frame losses, on Sigfox device energy performance. Among others, evaluation results show that the considered Sigfox device, powered by a 2400 mAh battery, can achieve a theoretical lifetime of 1.5 or 2.5 years while sending one message every 10 min at 100 bit/s or 600 bit/s, respectively, and an asymptotic lifetime of 14.6 years as the message transmission rate decreases.},

To mitigate this problem, various methods, and techniques for detecting and repelling animals in crop fields have been developed. In this study, we conducted a survey to investigate the current state of the art in animal detection and repellent systems in crop fields. Our survey included a review of relevant articles published in scientific journals and conference proceedings. The results of our survey indicate that a variety of methods and techniques are currently being used, including physical barriers, sensory networks, video analytics, and hybrid techniques. However, there is a lack of standardization and comparison among these methods, and further research is needed to evaluate their effectiveness and determine the most appropriate solutions for different types of crops and environments. Our findings provide a useful resource for farmers, researchers, and industry professionals working to address the problem of animal pests in crop fields.},

  abstract = {People residing on the outskirts of forests encounter numerous challenges in their daily lives due to conflicts between humans and wild animals. This conflict has resulted in the loss of lives among both the local population and farmers, as well as substantial livestock casualties. The Gujarat Forest Department has reported that 12 individuals have lost their lives, 70 have been injured, and 3927 cattle have been killed. To address this conflict, various government initiatives have been implemented to track and monitor wild animals. This paper presents a deep learning-based model to track wild animals in real-time from camera footage. In this study, we propose the utilization of the YOLOv8 architecture to detect four distinct categories: Lions, Tigers, Leopards, and Bears. The dataset is constructed from various documentaries, YouTube videos, and existing datasets from Kaggle. This dataset contains 1619 images with annotated four categories of objects. We trained three different YOLOv8 architectures (medium - YOLOv8m, large - YOLOv8l, and extra-large - YOLOv8x) on our dataset. To improve the accuracy of our model, we applied various types of augmentation to the dataset images. The trained extra-large model achieved a mAP of 94.3\%, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting wild animals in real time at 20 FPS.},
