\section{Requirement Analysis}

\subsection{Stakeholder Analysis}

This project can affect several type of future users. This needs to be considered to stablish the scenarios the system will face. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Farmers}: The end users who will utilize the system to protect their crops and properties. The jobs these farmers carry out can differ, for example, one farmer can be the owner of the system 
    and others can just be workers that also need to access the system.
    \item \textbf{Maintenance Personnel}: If any problem appears, these users are responsible for maintaining the system and ensuring it's proper functioning.
    \item \textbf{Equipment and Sensor Suppliers}: Companies that supply necessary components, such as \acrfullr{mcu}, smoke, flame or motion sensors.
    \item \textbf{Internet Service Providers}: These companies supply the resources for edge computing and internet connectivity.
    \item \textbf{Governmental and Regulatory Organizations}: Entities that ensure the system complies with agricultural and safety regulations.
    \item \textbf{Agricultural Consultants}: Professionals who advise farmers on integrating and using the system in their agricultural practices.
    \item \textbf{Energy Suppliers}: Companies that provide energy solutions, such as solar panels, to power the system.
    \item \textbf{Local Community}: Neighbors and other local stakeholders who could indirectly benefit from the system's implementation.
    \item \textbf{Investors and Financiers}: Entities or individuals who provide the necessary funds for the system's development and implementation.
