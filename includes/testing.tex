\section{Testing and Validation}

For the testing and validation of the first stage of the project, \texttt{NodeRed}\cite{NodeRED} was used. This application 
allows for block-based programming and it's mainly focused on fast development for data pipelining and high level testing.

In this project, this tool was used to simulate the nodes and all the traffic sent by MQTT. The main flow constantly sends 
telemetry and for the validation, event are inserted manually. The flow can be seen in \autoref{fig:validationFlow}.

This tool was used to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Test the best format for the traffic of the nodes.
    \item Constantly check the correct implementation of the functionalities.
    \item Insert alarms in the system to further implement new functionalities in the dashboard.
\end{itemize}
