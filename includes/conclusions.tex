\section{Conclusions and Next Steps}

The research done for this project shows the importance of \acrshort{iot} solutions in the farming industry. More specific, new solutions need 
to be achieved in the design of crop protection applications. And most importantly, fires are not the only risk that farm faces.

Some possible solutions that are being studied in this project are the use of \acrshort{pir} sensors in order to achieve a high level of 
power efficiency. If this reactive data is sent using low power wireless technologies like \acrshort{lorawan}, it can be use 
for new scenarios like machine learning, applied decision support algorithms and more. To support this, the use of \acrshort{mec} is mandatory.

In the first stage, the edge platform main functionalities and decision systems were implemented, along with simulated devices and dashboard solutions to 
give the user all the necessary information processed in a real-time manner.

For the next stage of the project, the hardware implementation of the nodes will be the main objective. Secondly, efforts will be used to implement the network 
control subsystem and it's functionalities.
